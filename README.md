👋 Hi, I’m pete nuwayser and @pnuw-ibm is my work account.

👀 I’m interested in elevating the improvement of developer experience from an IT or HR goal to a business goal. that means we strive to make visible the elements of:
- individual developer happiness
- automation mindset
- engineering team cohesion
- and their traceability to organizational goals like acquiring and retaining talent, increasing organizational resilience, and improving systems of customer value.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a better human.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automated testing for human understanding, so we can spend less time on training LLMs than on training humans.
